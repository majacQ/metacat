  "description": "This dataset includes results of laboratory experiments which measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) usage by natural bacteria in seawater at different pCO2 levels. Included in this dataset are; bacterial abundance, total organic carbon (TOC), what DOC was added to the experiment, target pCO2 level. ",
